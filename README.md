Node API for vendme app
Small markets (flea markets, farmer markets, etc.) can display how many stalls they have available and of what size. They can also list the current vendors and link to the vendor's profile so customers can see their products. Vendors can  rent available stalls on the application and have a display for their store. Merchants can upload and update their inventory or services to display on their profile.
